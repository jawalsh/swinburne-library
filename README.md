# The Personal library and presumed reading of Algernon Charles Swinburne

## About The Project

This project is a [TEI](https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html)-encoded bibliography—with links to full-text resources—of the personal library and presumed reading of Victorian poet and critic [Algernon Charles Swinburne](http://swinburneproject.org/). 

Swinburne was a poet, critic, and a major cultural figure of the Victorian period. Because of Swinburne’s fame and influence and his prominence in the network of people, events, and documents in Victorian culture, the data presented here should be of interest to anyone studying Victorian literature, art, and culture. In particular, the data could be used to:

- profile the reading habits of an important Victorian literary and cultural figure;
- compare Swinburne’s library with the libraries of other cultural figures;
- assemble a full-text corpus for computational text analysis of the content of a Victorian personal library;
- explore questions related to book history and readership.

More details about the project and the data will be included in a forthcoming data paper.

Explore the data in the [`swinburne_library.xml`](swinburne_library.xml) TEI/XML data file and the accompanying [data dictionary](data_dictionary.md).
